# TINY HACKS
Simple **10-day hackathon** to help you make things that excite you.

## The Challenge
You have **10 days** to **create a project of your choice**. The projects can be of any type ranging from an mobile app to digital artwork, video, food recipe or anything that excites you (Hacking is not limited to coding). That's not it, once you are done with the project you have to **share it with the world** and **get validations from people** (your friends, family, and the community) on the awesomeness of your app (get upvotes on github PR as :heart:, :thumbsup: or :tada:).

## How to participate

Hack will take a total of 20 days to complete.
